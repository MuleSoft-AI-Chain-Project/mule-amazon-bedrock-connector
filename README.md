## Why MAC AWS Bedrock Connector?

AWS Bedrock provides an unified AI Platform to design, build and manage autonomous agents and the needed architecture. While AWS Bedrock is very strong in connecting multiple LLM providers, the way to interact varies from LLM to LLM. The MAC AWS Bedrock Connector provides the ability to connect to all supported LLMs through an unification layer.

### Installation (using maven central dependency)

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>io.github.mulesoft-ai-chain-project</groupId>
   <artifactId>mule4-amazon-bedrock-connector</artifactId>
   <version>{version}</version>
   <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
```

### Installation (building locally)

To use this connector, first [build and install](https://mac-project.ai/docs/aws-bedrock/getting-started) the connector into your local maven repository.
Then add the following dependency to your application's `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
    <artifactId>mule4-amazon-bedrock-connector</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
    <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
```

### Installation into private Anypoint Exchange

You can also make this connector available as an asset in your Anyooint Exchange.

This process will require you to build the connector as above, but additionally you will need
to make some changes to the `pom.xml`.  For this reason, we recommend you fork the repository.

Then, follow the MuleSoft [documentation](https://docs.mulesoft.com/exchange/to-publish-assets-maven) to modify and publish the asset.
